		<outline text="Selecting text with mouse in the outline using Chrome doesn't work, just like Fargo " created="Wed, 13 Jul 2016 19:53:04 GMT">

		<outline text="I like the private/public model, but I think I will still want a way to copy privateFiles somewhere else for backup, I could live with creating a S3 bucket just for private files and perhaps a second callback script. " created="Wed, 13 Jul 2016 19:53:59 GMT">
